## Whatâ€™s the project about?
- Does regular exercise reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety in individuals diagnosed with mental health conditions?
- Why is this important?
    - Poor mental health -> workplace absenteeism/reduced productivity
    - Companies can invest in wellness programs to improve employee well-being

## Variables

- **Mental health outcomes:** scores for depression and anxiety
- **Exercise behavior:** frequency, duration, and/or intensity (light, moderate, vigorous)
- **Demographics:** Age, gender, socioeconomic status (SES)
- **Baseline health:** Pre-existing conditions, genetic predisposition
- **Treatment factors:** Medication use, therapy involvement

## Conclusions
- **Adjust for** age (multiple path appearances), gender (pipe), SES (common cause), pre-existing conditions (common cause)
- **Do not adjust for** therapy, medication, genetic predisposition (colliders)

## Data Source

- Self-reported survey data (convenience)
- Questions:
    - <span style="font-size: smaller;">**On average, how many minutes of exercise do you do per day?**<span>
    - <span style="font-size: smaller;">**What type(s) of exercise do you participate in regularly?**<span>
    - <span style="font-size: smaller;">**What is your age/gender/SES?**<span>
    - <span style="font-size: smaller;">**What physical conditions do you currently experience?**<span>
    - <span style="font-size: smaller;">**Do you have diagnosed depression/anxiety?**<span>
        - <span style="font-size: smaller;">could be replaced with questions from common depression/anxiety screeners<span>

## Next Steps
